## Wangkanai Solver: Optimize and Simulate Like Never Before

Wangkanai `Solver` is not just another mathematical library. It's a powerhouse for handling complex mathematical problems.
Solver provides you with the means to find the best possible solution for a myriad of problems, even when dealing with extensive datasets.
It excels in finding optimal maximal or minimal values of given functions and in modeling intricate systems using decision variables and constraints.

This ambitious project, grounded in a 20-year journey that began with a bachelor's thesis on management information systems, aims to redefine how we approach mathematical optimization and simulation.
The goal is to enable solutions for challenges like optimum manufacturing production capacity planning and other complex problems.

The path to solving these problems is filled with obstacles and challenges.
Yet, with the collective strength of a community of developers, we can overcome these hurdles.
So, join us on this exciting journey. Your stars :star: will not only motivate us but also help us reach more people and gather a community of like-minded developers eager to revolutionize mathematical problem solving.
